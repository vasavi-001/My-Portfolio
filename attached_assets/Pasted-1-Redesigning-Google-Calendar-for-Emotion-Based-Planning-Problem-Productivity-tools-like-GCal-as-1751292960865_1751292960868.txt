1. "Redesigning Google Calendar for Emotion-Based Planning"
Problem: Productivity tools like GCal assume humans operate like robots. But our energy, mood, and emotional state fluctuate.
Idea: A Google Calendar redesign that layers emotional context over traditional time blocks — like “creative,” “social,” “deep focus,” or “recovery.”
What You’d Show:

User interviews on how mood impacts productivity

Proposed mood-tag calendar UX with soft AI suggestions

A toggle for “drag & drop by energy” instead of time
PM Value: Shows product intuition, UX sensitivity, and emotional intelligence — perfect for wellness/AI tools.

🧠 2. "Fixing Spotify’s Algorithm for Gen Z Listeners"
Problem: Spotify’s “Recommended” playlists feel repetitive or irrelevant over time — especially for users whose moods change rapidly.
Solution: Rethink the music graph by clustering recommendations by vibe shifts (e.g., “energetic bounce” → “reflective low”) rather than genre/artist.
What You’d Show:

A case for behavior-driven clustering

UX mockups of “Mood Maps” and swipe-to-shift-feed music

A/B test plan comparing default Spotify UX vs your version
PM Value: Great for consumer AI, recommendation engines, retention

🌍 3. "Designing a Micro-Internship Platform for Tier-2/Tier-3 Students in India"
Problem: Millions of students outside top colleges don’t get real-world projects or resume builders.
Solution: A micro-internship platform that matches early learners with 2–3 week “sprints” from indie startups and solo founders.
What You’d Show:

Research on Indian job market inequality

A lean MVP structure: onboarding, task scoping, founder-review system

Monetization: freemium for startups, premium matchmaking
PM Value: Social impact + marketplace dynamics + underserved market thinking

🧳 4. "Rebuilding Airbnb for Solo Women Travelers"
Problem: Safety and cultural context are major blockers for solo women travelers — not addressed well in the UX.
Solution: Build a mode inside Airbnb that:

Flags female-friendly hosts

Curates hosts who offer local support/safe zones

Adds "emotional intent" like “healing trip” or “work reset” to recommendations
What You’d Show:

Research on travel anxiety and social media support groups

Persona-focused design

UX flow with empathy-based filters
PM Value: Productizing safety + experience curation, especially relevant for your Modern Chanakya travel theme

✍️ 5. "Can We Turn Notion into a Daily Journal Therapist?"
Problem: Notion is widely used for productivity but underused for emotional journaling. Most journaling apps feel too fluffy or too static.
Solution: A Notion template and plugin system that:

Nudges questions based on recent entries

Flags thought patterns using sentiment AI

Links emotion logs to productivity logs
What You’d Show:

A journaling workflow backed by behavioral psych

Integration of GPT-style emotional insights

Privacy & personalization features
PM Value: Creative AI application + mental health awareness + system thinking

Bonus Ideas (for future):
“What if Duolingo taught negotiation instead of Spanish?”

“Designing a Tinder for co-founders — team compatibility over pitch decks”

“Rebuilding Instagram Reels for actual skill-learning”

💡 Pro Tip: Treat these like real case studies — add them to your portfolio with:

Problem → Insight → Hypothesis → MVP Plan → Wireframe (Figma) → Success Metric

Even a half-built Notion/Miro + Loom walkthrough makes it feel legit
